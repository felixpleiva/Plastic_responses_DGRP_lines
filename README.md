## Notes:
All processing was done in R. The R folder contains the scripts, numbered consecutively, to reproduce the analyzes and generate tables and figures presented in the manuscript. The outputs folder contains the output files of each R scripts. The starting number of each one of these files-e.g., “1.1.1. Data to fit the models.csv”- identifies the source script "1.0. Data wrangling.r".  

## R packages
The software and R packages associated with each script are enlisted in the corresponding R session file.
